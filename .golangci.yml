  - name: durationcheck
    desc: |
      durationcheck complains about *any* multiplication of time.Durations, as
      *some* might be incorrect. Unfortunately we do need to perform some of
      those multiplications.

  - name: exhaustivestruct
    desc: |
      exhaustivestruct is meant for special checking only. It verifies that all
      fields are set in struct construction, and so is not useful for us

  - name: funlen
    desc: |
      funlen is annoying

  - name: godot
    desc: |
      godot requires that top-level comments end with a dot. This is useful for
      documentation purposes when documentation is generated automatically.
      However, we do not document our code and therefore this linter has no
      value for us.

  - name: goerr113
    desc: |
      goerr113 requires to not use errors.New, instead it wants us to define
      package-level errors and wrap them. This feels to be an overkill so we
      are skipping it for now.

  - name: gofumpt
    desc: |
      gofumpt also includes gofumports. These are a stricter version of gofmt
      and goimports respectively. By enabling them we also wanted to include
      them in our vim configurations to be run on save. Unfortunately this
      makes vim.coc report errors very slowly, or not at all. If we decide to
      enable them back we should also make sure that they work in our vim
      configs.

  - name: gomoddirectives
    desc: |
      gomoddirectives allows only some or outright bans all replace directives
      in the go.mod files. Since importing kubernetes packages is a nighmare we
      actually need the replace directive.

  - name: interfacer
    desc: |
      interfacer is deprecated

  - name: maligned
    desc: |
      maligned is deprecated

  - name: noctx
    desc: |
      noctx requires using a context when constructing an http.Request.
      However, as for the time being we are not passing contexts to our
      functions, so just using `context.Background` to make the linter happy
      does not really make sense

  - name: paralleltest
    desc: |
      paralleltest seems to think all tests should be parallel. We'll let
      ginkgo decide that.

  - name: scopelint
    desc: |
      scopelint is deprecated

  - name: unparam
    desc: |
      Didn't like it complaining about always using port 8080 in a function

  - name: wrapcheck
    desc: |
      we don't believe in wrapping all errors, especially from our interfaces
