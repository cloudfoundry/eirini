## Coding Guidelines

* Discuss whenever desired
* Some good [general advice](https://medium.com/@benbjohnson/standard-package-layout-7cdbc8391fc1)
* Comments
  - Generally avoid them
  - Codify things that need explanation (function names, interfaces, etc)
  - Only comment things that are surprising or deviate from a standard
* Tracker Updates
  - Mark git commits with the story number so that anyone picking up a story has a chance to see what code is in progress
  - If that isn't working, leave a comment in the story with a pointer to the commit
