a sync loop (similar to nsync) that uses pluggable 'OPI' backends to convert CC apps in to backend resources.

# Usage

~~~~
# make sure ~/.kube/config points to a valid kube
eirini sync --ccApi <api.your-env.com> --ccPass <your_internal_user_admin_pass> --adminPass <your_cf_admin_pass> --skipSslValidation

or use a config file:

eirini sync --config <path/to/config/file.yml>

# example config file:

sync:
  api_endpoint: "https://api.bosh-lite.com"
  registry_endpoint: "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
  cc_internal_user: "internal_user"
  cc_internal_password: "internal-password"
  cf_username: "admin"
  cf_password: "cfpass"
  skip_ssl_validation: true
  insecure_skip_verify: true

# (in another window..) watch your cf apps appear in kube
kubectl get deployments --watch

# push a docker image based app, it'll appear as a deployment in kube next time
the sync loop runs
cf push -o myimage mydockerapp

# nb: this will currently just push busybox because it doesn't now how to grab
# a URI from the registry, but that's easy enough to fix
cf push mybuildpackapp

# Todo

Lots! There's tons of missing stuff here, but hopefully it shows the idea. 

 - Env vars, volumes, routes, security groups
 - Updating and deleting apps
 - Responding to CC requests so we dont have to wait for the sync loop and so `cf push/start` can see when the thing has succeeded
 - Caching the list of existing k8s resources and using a watch to keep it updated
 - Moving much of this in to CC (but then you have to write ruby: maybe the opi.Desire interface should be exposed as swagger and the sync loop - which is brain-dead simple - can happen in CC and use that api)
